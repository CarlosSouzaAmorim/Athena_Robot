I’m running the Gemma model, a large language model created by Google DeepMind. I’m an open-weights model, meaning my weights are publicly available. 

I don’t have access to a "witch model" in the traditional sense – I don't have a specific, pre-defined model with a particular purpose. My functionality is based on a large neural network trained on a massive dataset of text and code. 

Do you have any specific questions about how I work or what I'm designed to do?
